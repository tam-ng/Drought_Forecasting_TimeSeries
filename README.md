# Drought_Forecasting_TimeSeries


## Introduction
Globally, droughts are the biggest concern from climate change. Frequency and intensity of droughts has increased over the last century – Since 1900 Global droughts have affected 2 billion people and lead to more than 11 million deaths

## Objectives
- Our Focus: Horn of Africa
- Identified the most appropriate Time-Series method to forecast drought in African countries, acting as a critical early warning for drought managements
- With the goal of maximizing the impact of our predictions we have decided to focus on the region most affected by droughts: Somalia, Ethiopia

## Data
- Using Meteorlogical Drought indicator: SPEI
- Monthly SPEI measurements from the capitals of Somalia & Ethiopia

- SPEI: Measures drought severity according to its intensity and duration, and can identify the onset
and end of drought episodes
- SPEI takes into account both precipitation and potential evaporation in determining drought,
therefore, SPEI captures the main impact of increased temperatures on water demand

## Modeling
1.Benchmark Models: Naive, Mean, Seasoan Naive, Naive with drift

2.Exponential Smoothing

3.ARIMA, sARIMA

4.Spectral Analysis

5.VAR, Regression with ARIMA error

6.TBATS

7.ARCH/GARCH
